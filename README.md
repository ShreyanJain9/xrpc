# XRPC

This Gem provides the ability to use BlueSky's XRPC from Ruby! :) 

It's designed for use as a part of Bskyrb, but can be used independently. 

## Installation

Install the gem and add to the application's Gemfile by executing:

    $ bundle add xrpc

If bundler is not being used to manage dependencies, install the gem by executing:

    $ gem install xrpc

## Usage

TODO: Write usage instructions here

## Development

After checking out the repo, run `bin/setup` to install dependencies. You can also run `bin/console` for an interactive prompt that will allow you to experiment.

To install this gem onto your local machine, run `bash ./install-local.sh`. To release a new version, run `bash ./deploy.sh`, which will update the version number in `version.rb` and push the `.gem` file to [rubygems.org](https://rubygems.org).
